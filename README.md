# Sales Price Predication  Using Machine learning 

The growth of supermarkets in most populated cities are increasing and market competitions are also high. The dataset is one of the historical sales of supermarket company which has recorded in 3 different branches for 3 months data. Predictive data analytics methods are easy to apply with this dataset.

Analyzed Sales data of a Supermarket to improve their sales and increase the customer base.
Forecasted future sales using modeling techniques
Compared all the models and presented the various sales prediction for the upcoming 3 months.


# Implementation

I have developed a baseline machine learning algorithms like Linear Regression, DecisionTreeRegressor, KNeighborsRegressor, XGBRegressor, RandomForestRegressor and choose the best out of it. Then hyper parameter tuning is performed on the selected model for final model to get best results.

Final predictions are made on unseen data with the final model.
